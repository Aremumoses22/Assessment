## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Submitting
1. ✅ Test the app thoroughly
2. ✅ Generate PDF from TECHNICAL_WALKTHROUGH.md
3. ✅ Check that all code works
4. ✅ No console errors
5. ✅ Data persists after restart

### Assets Note
The `assets/` folder contains placeholder files. For production deployment, you'd replace these with actual PNG images. However, **for this case study, placeholders are fine** - the app will use Expo's default icons.

### Known Items
- Asset images are placeholders (not required for case study)
- Some npm warnings during install (normal, not errors)
- TypeScript extends expo/tsconfig.base (installed with dependencies)

## 🎬 Optional Bonus (If You Have Time)

### Create a Demo Video (5-10 minutes)
1. Screen record your device/simulator
2. Show: Add products, edit, delete, limit, persistence
3. Upload to YouTube or Loom
4. Add link to submission email

**Script:**
- "Here's my Product Management App built with React Native"
- "I can add products with photos from camera or gallery"
- "Each product has a name, price, and image"
- "I can add up to 5 products - watch what happens when I reach the limit"
- "I can edit any product by tapping on it"
- "I can delete products with the X button"
- "The data persists even when I close and reopen the app"

## 📞 If They Ask Technical Questions

### "Why Redux Toolkit instead of Context API?"
"Redux Toolkit provides better scalability, middleware support, DevTools integration, and is the industry standard for complex state management. While Context API works for simple cases, Redux Toolkit offers better performance with memoization and is easier to debug with time-travel debugging."

### "Why Expo instead of React Native CLI?"
"Expo provides a faster development cycle with managed builds, easy OTA updates, and built-in libraries. For this case study and MVP development, Expo offers the best balance of speed and functionality. However, I'm also comfortable with bare React Native CLI when native modules are required."

### "How did you handle offline storage?"
"I integrated AsyncStorage with Redux Toolkit's async thunks. The app automatically persists the entire product state to local storage whenever it changes, and loads it back when the app starts. This provides a seamless offline experience."

### "How would you scale this app?"
"I'd add: (1) Cloud sync with Firebase, (2) User authentication, (3) Product categories and search, (4) Multiple images per product, (5) Unit and E2E tests, (6) CI/CD pipeline, (7) Analytics and crash reporting with Sentry."
